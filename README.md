Javascript BPE Encoder Decoder for GPT-2/GPT-3

## About

GPT-2 and GPT-3 use byte pair encoding to turn text into a series of integers to feed into the model. This is a javascript implementation of OpenAI's original python encoder/decoder which can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2).

## Usage

```ts
const { encode, decode } = require('gpt-3-encoder')

const str = 'This is an example sentence to try encoding out on!'
const encoded = encode(str)
console.log('Encoded this string looks like: ', encoded)

console.log('We can look at each token and what it represents')
for (let token of encoded) {
	console.log({ token, string: decode([token]) })
}

const decoded = decode(encoded)
console.log('We can decode it back into:\n', decoded)
```
